# CIMFlow Framework

**CIMFlow** is a research-grade **compiler-simulator framework** for modeling neural network inference on Compute-In-Memory (CIM) hardware accelerators. It supports multi-core simulation, IR/ISA generation, performance evaluation, and energy modeling.

---

## üß† Project Overview

This framework takes a deep learning model (e.g., ResNet18 in ONNX format), compiles it into low-level instruction sets (ISA), and simulates execution on a CIM hardware model to measure cycles, energy, and performance.
